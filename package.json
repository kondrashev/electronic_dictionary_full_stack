  "description": "This project call 'Electronic dictionary'. The main idea of this project to help people which want to learn English to improve their vocabulary and pronunciation. For development this project I was using the following stack of technologies, namely: java, spring boot, spring security, spring data. Using opportunities of this project you can add, delete, edit categories and words. For separating words into categories I was using dependencies like 'one to many' and 'many to one'. This opportunity significantly simplified the procedure of deleting categories. You can also move words from one category into another. I think it's very convenient isn't?",
